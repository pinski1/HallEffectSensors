Hall effect sensors for brushless outrunner motors.

This repo contains Hall Effect Sensor PCBs for both internal and external sensors for a few motor diameters.

Many hobby brushless motors do not come with hall effect sensors for position information. By adding one of these boards, aligning it correctly you can pick up the rotation and improve low speed torque of your motor.

These particular ones are designed for 12 slot, 14 pole brushless motors, however the files do contain the formulae to calculate the nessesary spacing for different pole counts.

These versions/copies were inspired by Charles Guan at http://www.etotheipiplusone.net/

## Purchasing

I'm planning to sell these on Tindie at some point.

If you're in the US you may be better served by purchasing from http://e0designs.com/products/hall-effect-sensor-board/

## Parts List

A1221 hall effect sensor
100nF capacitor
ferrite bead
wires
mounting hardware

## Alignment Instructions

1. loosely affix the sensor array in it's mounting point. It will need to be slid sideways to align it.
2. Line up the center sensor with a slot on the stator laminations.
3. Complete.
